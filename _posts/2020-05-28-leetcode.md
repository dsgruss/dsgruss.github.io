I've recently been using [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) to brush up on those algorithm/CS-type
fundamentals that have degraded since my undergrad days. Here's a couple notes I've made over the
[first two weeks](https://leetcode.com/dsgruss/), in no particular order.

* [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/) is available. Quite a few problems I've found give a two-dimensional
  array in the form of `List[List[]]`, which I'll immediately pack into a `np.array`. This allows
  for both horizontal and vertical slicing (useful for, well, [slicing][1]) as well as the other
  `numpy` [n-dimensional routines][2]. Also, when `print`-ed, the rows and columns line up.

* Generator syntax for tree traversal. Writing something like
```python
def it(node):
    if(node):
        yield node
        yield from it(node.left)
        yield from it(node.right)
```
  makes it possible to do a `for n in node(root):` to iterate over all the nodes in a tree in a
  particular traversal order. Occasionally, the tree structure is too large for the recursion limit
  so it is sometimes necessary to write the stack/queue explicitly (as well as breadth-first search
  is [not as intuitive](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50307415) in generator form), but this allows
  for a quick implementation of a search as a first pass. The traversal order can be changed by
  altering the order of the `yield` statements. It's also useful to wrap things like linked-lists or
  palindrome numbers into generators.

* Getting to know the python standard library better. The `collections` module has some useful
  containers: [`deque`][3] for _O(1)_ implementations of a queue or stack, [`defaultdict`][4] to
  avoid `d.get(key, default)` all over, [`Counter`][5] to count items in lists and strings. Also,
  `dict` keys are guaranteed to be in insertion order since version 3.7. The
  [`heapq`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/heapq.html) module gives an implementation of a min
  heap and [`bisect`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html) gives efficient searching of
  sorted lists. Adding the [`@lru_cache(None)`][6] decorator to a recursive function can take it
  from "time limit exceeded" to "dynamic programming". And of course [`itertools`][7] seemingly has
  every way of sticking iterators together.

* I naturally find myself tending towards the simulation/numerical solution to the problem even
  though that is not usually the most efficient implementation. Times I've reached for `np.isclose`
  have all been wrong; floating point numbers hardly show their faces and most solutions have an
  exact answer. I've gone for the simulation solution for problems like [this][8] and
  [this][9]. Problems about solving equations seem to be more about correct parsing than eigenvalues
  and eigenvectors.

* I've used [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com) in the past, which has a similar in-browser
  coding process to solve a problem against test cases, but there the problems were organized into
  particular skills. I've been sticking to using the "random problem" button on LeetCode. Nothing
  wrong with either approach, just a difference.

* I took way too long to realize there is a "Tree Visualizer" button in the "Testcase" console,
  which gives a nice rendering of the input tree.

* [`sqlite3`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) is also available. I used it for the
  [design Twitter](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-twitter/) problem and the [design
  underground system](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-underground-system/) problem, but mostly
  just for the practice. You can provision an in-memory database using
  `conn=sqlite3.connect(':memory:')`.
