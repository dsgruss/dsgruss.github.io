I've recently been using [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) to brush up on those algorithm/CS-type fundamentals that have degraded since my undergrad days. Here's a couple notes I've made over the [first two weeks](https://leetcode.com/dsgruss/), in no particular order.

* [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/) is available. Quite a few problems I've found give a two-dimensional array in the form of `List[List[]]`, which I'll immediately pack into a `np.array`. This allows for both horizontal and vertical slicing (useful for, well, [slicing](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-of-cutting-a-pizza/)) as well as the other `numpy` [n-dimensional routines](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.array-manipulation.html). Also, when `print`-ed, the rows and columns line up.

* Generator syntax for tree traversal. Writing something like
```python
def it(node):
    if(node):
        yield node
        yield from it(node.left)
        yield from it(node.right)
```
makes it possible to do a `for n in node(root):` to iterate over all the nodes in a tree in a particular traversal order. Occasionally, the tree structure is too large for the recursion limit so it is sometimes necessary to write the stack/queue explicitly (as well as breadth-first search is [not as intuitive](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50307415) in generator form), but this allows for a quick implementation of a search as a first pass. The traversal order can be changed by altering the order of the `yield` statements. It's also useful to wrap things like linked-lists or palindrome numbers into generators.

* Getting to know the python standard library better. The `collections` module has some useful containers: [`deque`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque) for _O(1)_ implementations of a queue or stack, [`defaultdict`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict) to avoid `d.get(key, default)` all over, [`Counter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter) to count items in lists and strings. Also, `dict` keys are guaranteed to be in insertion order since version 3.7. The [`heapq`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/heapq.html) module gives an implementation of a min heap and [`bisect`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html) gives efficient searching of sorted lists. Adding the [`@lru_cache(None)`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache) decorator to a recursive function can take it from "time limit exceeded" to "dynamic programming". And of course [`itertools`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html) seemingly has every way of sticking iterators together.

* I naturally find myself tending towards the simulation/numerical solution to the problem even though that is not usually the most efficient implementation. Times I've reached for `np.isclose` have all been wrong; floating point numbers hardly show their faces and most solutions have an exact answer. I've gone for the simulation solution for problems like [this](https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix/) and [this](https://leetcode.com/problems/mirror-reflection/). Problems about solving equations seem to be more about correct parsing than eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

* I've used [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com) in the past, which has a similar in-browser coding process to solve a problem against test cases, but there the problems were organized into particular skills. I've been sticking to using the "random problem" button on LeetCode. Nothing wrong with either approach, just a difference.

* I took way too long to realize there is a "Tree Visualizer" button in the "Testcase" console, which gives a nice rendering of the input tree.

* [`sqlite3`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) is also available. I used it for the [design Twitter](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-twitter/) problem and the [design underground system](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-underground-system/) problem, but mostly just for the practice. You can provision an in-memory database using `conn=sqlite3.connect(':memory:')`.
